Dynamic read is defined as the user is to give the input value during the execution time
(or)
we can give the value at execution time 
intially some packages are used to for the classes and interfaces
without using any package name it will directly take into the "lang" package
but to read the dynamic values we must have the "Scanner" class which is belongs to the util package
to import util package we can use as
syntax;
import java.util.Scanner;
---> Scanner class has to create an object the syntax shown below
Scanner variablename=new Scanner(System.in);
variabletype variablename1=variablename.nextvariabletype
ex:
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
int n=s.nextInt()
--->
here each datatype has each value that is
int--->nextInt();
float
