in java there are totally five operators
//operators are 
-->arithematic
--->logical
---->unary
----->terinary operators
//Arithematic operators 
//they are +,-,/,*,% 
//'+' operator is used to add two or more values
//'-' operator is used to subtract two or more values
//'*' operator is used to  multiply the values
//'/' division operator is used to remove last digit in the number and also it divides the numbers and returns the quotient value
//'%' operator is used to take a last digit from the number and also it will return the remainder between the numbers
//these  are only applicable for single value or variable cannot be used as a conditions
//using simple addition operator using direct values
class P
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
				
		System.out.println(7+7);	//14
	}
}
//using simple by using local variables
class Q 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int a=7;
		int b=12;
		System.out.println(a+b);	//19
	}
}
//program to perform all arithmatic operations
class R
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int a=14;
		int b=5;
		System.out.println(a+b);	//19
    		System.out.println(a-b);	//9
		System.out.println(a*b);	//70
		System.out.println(a/b);	//2
		System.out.println(a%b);	//4

	}
}
// Logical Operators
//Here in this the logical operators are logical AND (&&),logical or(||) ,and finally logical Not(!)
//logical AND is defined as both the conditions should satisfy at a  same time i.e both the conditions are true then the statements will get excuted
//logical OR is defined as if either one  statement is true or two statemnts are true then the set of statements will be excuted
//in other in any of the condition is true then it will get executed otherwise diplays nothing
//program for &&,||,! operators
class S
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
     int a=14;
      System.out.println(a>10 && a==15);    // false 
      System.out.println(a>10 || a<=15);    //true
      System.out.println(a!=0);              //true
  }
}
//the above code can also be written by using to  store result in one variable and then print it 
class T
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
int a =14;
boolean res=a>10 && a==15;
boolean res2=a>10 || a<=15;
boolean res3=a!=0;
      System.out.println(res);    // false 
      System.out.println(res2);    //true
      System.out.println(res3);    //true
  }
}
